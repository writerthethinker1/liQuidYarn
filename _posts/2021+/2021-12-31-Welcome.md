Welcome to liQuidYarn! The site is complete and there's tons to explore! Hope you have a great time trying to play around with the ideas. Before we get going, let's just note a couple of things. If you really like the articles and ideas, why not make a purchase and check out some of our goods and code? YouÊ»re supporting free press and quantum physics!

These are all explicit quantum ideas. They are left here, in unencrypted format. They are uncensored and left for you to *think freely.*

The ideas are for those who find them. **No company may claim use of them alone.** Do what you wish with the ideas but learn that people genuinely enjoy *peaceful times more*, it is human nature to like being peaceful and hate the opposite. Remember all the problems humanity has jointly, in addition. Solve those that give peace, tranquility, and genuine happiness for many people above other problems. Know what might happen if certain people (professors, politicians, students, ordinary people, and so on...) have access to it and ask yourself if times later will be peaceful or not. We live in a time where there are many conflicts and disputes.

> Population control and ideological conflict have actually taken us generations away from tools and ideas that might help along the way to longevity and true enjoyment of life. Keep this in mind when you start learning. (There are also other examples in the past showing how intelligent minds have been brainwashed into creating weapons, making chaos, and hurting the lives of others using violent means as opposed to higher order thinking).

**Critically: do we even need these ideas if true happiness lies within, all without knowledge of quantum mechanical technologies?** What exactly do you want to do in a world filled with ever growing problems we collectively create? Can this really solve them?

Also be careful about central rule and totalitarian rule, don't let nations abuse their power or else you'll end up in some kind of enforced rule having little room to think for yourself. All of these ideas came from original thought and the ability to think freely. *How well do your leaders keep the world? Peaceful? Conflicting? What do you like? What do you not like?* Try a rational approach to evaluating them.

## Themes/Ideas

There's many things here, and I hope you question them, and *find errors*, not everything written is 'correct.' But, you might get the idea of what's being written.  

> If you learn them well, you might be able to help others as well! Maybe fight climate change? solve complex problems? Stop obesity? Cure rare diseases? Who knows, maybe the world will be better...maybe we can learn more about the atom then? Make quantum theories easier? Could there really be a *different way to think about atomic phenomena so that it makes sense?!* Maybe a world were we know quantum as easy as newtonian, you pick which one you want to learn first!

## Pandora's Box

You will also find a pandora's box topic with some other ideas about logic, stats, math, and sign theory. These don't have anything to do with quantum per se, but are ways to think differently and expand ideas there. So you can see things coming ahead of time before you have to read. They also have theories for other fields in a purely *classical* setting.

## No central text

Lastly, there is no central text explaining most of the ideas given here. What you see are the ideas themselves, q-logic has more depth and information than other areas and the connection folder is there for those who find the jump too hard. But, other than that, you won't find some giant book with all the ideas and *you are free to take notes and not to publish the ideas for me, what's given is meant to stay 'as is'.*

That being said, you are free to summarize *hand written copies* of the notes and to *type out your own* interpretations (remember, there might be errors I didn't correct or didn't get a chance to see myself). Your own words and typing are yours and can be made free for everyone, but just make sure to spread the message of peace and equality, to use the technologies in ways to keep humanity calm and aware.

> liQidYarn is a decentralized place to give ideas about quantum mechanics and discuss creative ways to solve old problems. It has no relation whatsoever with any person, sex, nation, school or whatever boundary we make.

Enjoy playing around with the ideas! Check out the liq section too, there's stuff there too!
