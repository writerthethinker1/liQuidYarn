# Xenaʻs Medicinal Standard

---

> This is Xenaʻs *medicinal standard* to access if any labeled medicine is truly legitimate. We donʻt want any fake goods/medicine out there that could *harm others!* When we say something is "medicine," it needs to have *some kind of medicinal effect.* A medicinal effect is all about healing the body and repairing it rather than *harming it*. So, what do we want *all medicine* to have?

## Standards for all Medicine

1. *Authenticity:* We want *all medicine* to be authentic, meaning authorized and made by licensed *Ph.Dʻs or M.Dʻs*. We canʻt, in a rapidly changing cosmos, have *untrained* or *unqualified* people make goods for medicine.
2. *Potency:* We want all medicine to be *potent*, meaning "each dose [correct] has efficacy." So, whenever each person takes any type of medicine, the medicine, under the *right/correct* usage, has the *intended effect to some degree.*
3. *Overdosing/Misuse:* All medicine that is made has "certified safety" in that the doctors and users know what an overdose is. It is very clear (or should be) what an *overdose* is and therein, any misuse or abuse of the drug.

* This standard is based off of the *Medicine Buddha Syrup!* It is proven to heal *all sicknesses*, so it lays down all safety and methods for *diagnosing*, *treating*, *preventing disease*.
* The frequency of the syrup is $\varphi^2$.
