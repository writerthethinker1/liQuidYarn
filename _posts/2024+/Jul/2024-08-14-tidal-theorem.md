# Tidal Theorem

---

> This note is all about proving the *tidal theorem*, which is all about the *linear sum of numbers.* This theorem is fundamental to the *tidal stone* which is a *Xena stone* good for locations where there is a lot of *lead* and *heavy metals*. It allows the user to *levitate*, use *lightning*, and summon *yellow fire.* Let ªs prove the *tidal theorem*.

## The Theorem

We want a general formula for

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n}i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n.
$$

We can get this formula by writing the sum backward:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^n i = n + (n-1) + \dots + 2 + 1
$$

and then adding the two to get:

$$
2\sum_{i = 1}^n i = \underbrace{(n + 1) + (n + 1) + \dots + (n + 1)}_{n \text{ times}} \\ = n(n+1)
$$

This can be simplified to get...

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

This is the *general formula* for the *linear sum of numbers!* As desired. $\blacksquare$
