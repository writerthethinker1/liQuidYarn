# Blue Sword Standards | Mount Olympus

---

To really make a good proof, idea, or product; it needs to be approved by the blue sword and follow the *Olympic standard.* This means *honesty, integrity, trust, and authenticity*. Hereʻs the standard...

1. *Logic:* If results donʻt follow a logical paradigm, then the end gain is worthless. Meaning, the idea is *fraudulent* and wonʻt work even with more application. In the cosmos, some things just wonʻt work. Period.
2. *Peer Review:* Everything you say is true needs to be backed up by your peers in a rigorous peer-review. You can also use items like the *blue sword*, etc... in place of peer-review. If nothing is backed-up by anything, then the result is *confidential* and canʻt be shared by *anyone*. If you really donʻt have any support of a review, ideas donʻt count because you are just assuming something is true and forcing everyone to believe you.  
3. *Doping:* Use of illegal items/substances or performance enhancing drugs (e.g. steroids) is *forever prohibited*. Everything must be authentic and *real*. If you use a steroid to improve performance, you must follow the Olympic rule to make-up for it. A detox with a rigorous work-out regimen must take place.
4. *Integrity:* You must always uphold and follow the *Olympic Standard*. So, cheating and hiring someone to do your work for you is *banned*. There are *severe consequences* for having someone do your work for you and the person hiring the other person to complete the work is held accountable. At the end of the day, the person who wished to cheat is held accountable. Not anyone else.
5. *Equality:* Everyone is treated equally and with due respect. This means that no one is *superior* to anyone else. This allows for authentic discussion and a natural *inquiry* into the *laws* of the *cosmos*. Weʻll never really know what the Universe really is with *bias* and *appeals*. At the end of the day, a *mistake* is a *mistake* regardless of who did it. They always need to be held accountable.

> Everything comes sealed using the *cascading blue sword* seal of the *Olympians*.
