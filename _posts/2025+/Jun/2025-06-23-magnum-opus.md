# Magnum Opus | Publishing

Iʻm just publishing this official document so we globally know that the philosopher stone is real and have a systematic process for making it. This paper really gives the silent truth about the physicistʻs tools and how they alone are sufficient to make the stone. We know in 2025 that all diseases have a common cure, and this is great especially in a pandemic where millions are sick and worried. We also have a routine process to make gold and really explore topics like fusion and fission. The paper is self-sufficient, so everything you need to make the stone, explore it, and see what it can do is given. Best!
