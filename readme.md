## It's Quantum!

> Initial release: 31.12.21; Golden!

Welcome! I hope you enjoy playing with these quantum themed ideas! They're all on the website linked in this repo! Go check it out, you're free to share and distribute the ideas!

In time, they will be released complete with proofs and explanations!

We will be taking a closer look at some concepts about *chance, games, statistics, math, computer science, etc...* (Even literature and writing).

> It's a whole quantum universe!

And...as a bonus, we will be *connecting classical theories with quantum theories!* Things like Newtonian with Quantum Mechanical or at least showing logically why the two differ in interpretation. Maybe for a grand unified theory approach. Who knows? You will see how if we change some of the rules around how you can approach quantum theories from classical ones.

We'll start with classical logic and work our way up to a quantum logic by introducing chance.

Welcome to 2022! Hope it's great, full of joy and maybe new resolutions! There's something for everyone!

1. Physicists
2. Chemists
3. Anthropologists
4. Machine Learning Engineers
5. Statistics
6. Mathematicians
7. Logicians
8. Philosophers, Humanities
9. AI Engineers
10. Coders
11. Computer Scientists
12. and so on...

The ideas are still works in progress and slowly information will pan out when the articles are decent. Overtime, you'll find posts for various topics.

> We'll tie it all together with *the connection.* Connecting mechanics with quantum or at least explaining how the two grew to be separate.
