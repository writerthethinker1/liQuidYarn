> Up to a certain point, science has problems and we eventually, using heavy logic, must accept the inevitable; that life has a spiritual foundation and we play an active role in it each day. Take the field of metaphysics, this is actually a real science. Metaphysics is the key to understanding special relativity and spirituality. There are tools and laws in the world of metaphysics and they are all spiritual.
