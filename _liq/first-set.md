## First set: Math

**5 problems: 30min.**

> Focus! Block out distractions! Your time will NOT be taken into account when measuring your $iq^\ell$. You can take all of it or less, once you think you are done, you can't edit anymore. So, finishing early gives you nothing.

## No. 1

Simplify

$$
\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{b}{a}} = \frac{\frac{b}{a}}{\frac{a}{b}}
$$

$a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ but **can't be zero.**

## No. 2

If $a^2 = b^2$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, does it mean that $a=b$ always?

Yes? No? Explain.

## No. 3

If $a^4 = b^4$ does it always mean $a^2 = b^2$ for real $a,b$?

How about if $a^6 = b^6$, does it mean that $a = b$?

## No. 4

The law of sines is written

$$
\frac{\sin(a)}{A} = \frac{\sin(b)}{B} = \frac{\sin(c)}{C}
$$

What's the smallest $A$ can be? how about $a$? are these two quantities directly or inversely related?

## No. 5

Now the pythagorean theorem states

$$
\sin^2(a) + \sin^2(\pi/2 - a) = r^2
$$

What's the domain of $r$?

That is, what could the values for $r$ be?
