Welcome to the second set!

5 questions, 30min.

Theme: statistics, all questions from statistics. These are from basic statistics for everyone, no specialised knowledge required. Suitable for the general person.

> Focus! Block out distractions! Your time will NOT be taken into account when measuring your $\text{iq}^\ell$. You can take all of it or less, once you think you are done, you can't edit anymore. So, finishing early gives you nothing.

Good luck! :)

## No. 1

If $X \sim \text{Bern}(p, 1-p)$ does it mean that $X$ models a fair coin toss?

If it is coin toss, fair or not, what is the smallest $p$ can be? Explain?

## No. 2

Suppose you sample $X_1,. . . ,X_n$ from a population of mice. You obtain $\bar{X}$ for an average of the quantity you wanted.

Does a positive value of $\bar{X}$ mean that the sample has all positive values?

## No. 3

The sides of a right triangle are random. At most, how many could be random by themselves? That is, how many can change independently of each other?

## No. 4

Two people have a birthday today. What's the chance they will have it on the same day again? It is Saturday today. No leap years.

## No. 5

Charlie brought a peanut butter sandwich to work and the staff became jealous. He said he would give half of it to whichever person can roll, using 2 6 sided dice, the product as 13.

What's the chance of this happening?

> That's the end of the second set. Hope you did well!
