I hope this will be a fun site for you to visit for relaxation and a break from the usual stuff in life. If you are student, maybe these notes can help you see other ways of approaching the same problems. If you have experience with quantum mechanics or are an instructor, you might like these quantum themed articles.

> Just remember, these are just works in progress. There might be errors and you or your buddies will have to make sure what's written agrees with observations.

Relax, have some tea, meditate, and read on! Regardless of who you are, there's something for everybody.
